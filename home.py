This app allows you to further inspect the results presented in the Master's thesis
"Review on end-to-end AutoML systems" by Ilhem Bekkar. The thesis discusses an empirical study about the different AutoML systems design and its limitations,
and contextualizes the results. While we provide some additional context in this app, we strongly encourage you to 
read the thesis before drawing any conclusions.
